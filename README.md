This is a simple transactional system. 
There are different apps: product, user, orderitems and jwtauth for authentication 
purpose.
One can register himself as a user/merchant can have access to all the features of the
system. 
There are several features like listview, create, update, delete, details to each app.
We are using mysql db to this project.
The basic flow of this system is given below:
Register User>Add store>Add Product>OrderProduct
Setup guide or Requirement file is attached with the core file.
